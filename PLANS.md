# FUTURE PLANS

## This document covers some of the new improvements for this project in the future.

1. Add functionality to choose player's name

As players keep score of their won games in the scoreboard, it would be great to be able to see their own name with their score. This could be implemented by letting the user choose a username before joining the game-room, while checking the camera and microphone work well in the waiting-room.

2. Add sharing functionality of the scoreboard

What makes it more fun to play a game than being able to share with the rest of the world how you won against a friend? The sharing functionality could be added with a "Share" button next to the scoreboard. The more social media pages available to share, the better. However, it is more likely to be shared in the ones that have "stories" like Instagram, Snapchat or Twitter. Users could even personalize the design of the scoreboard before posting it. They should also be able to download the screenshot of the scoreboard in case they don't want to put their login credentials in that device.

3. Add web notifications to notify users when someone entered the room.

Web notifications are easy to implement and they can improve remarkably the user's experience. We value people's privacy, so we think it's important to let the people in the room know when someone entered the room too. The notification should be configurable by the users so that they choose to enable/disable it and, in case they want to enable it, choose if it should make a sound.  

4. Allow users to turn off the microphone and camera in the waiting room.

As for the moment, users are only able to turn the microphone and camera on to check if everything is ok. We think it would be a nice touch to let them switch between off/on anytime they want by clicking the same button.

5. Add more characters to the game

Even though cats are loved by most people, we think it would be more fun to let the users choose between different characters to play the game. New sets of characters could be added from time to time so that players don't get used to playing with the same ones over and over again. These new characters could be human characters, different animals, add different clothing to each of them...

6. Add a different game mode with a timer so the players have less time to think of their questions.

If some players want to make the game more interesting, we could add another game mode where each player has a certain amount of time that we could show as a countdown every turn to ask a question about the other player's character. This game's winner depends a lot of asking the right questions based on previous answers. Having a limit of time to ask the questions could be an important factor to see which one of the players thinks faster under pressure.

7. Add another game mode with the possibility to form teams (2 vs 2, for example).

One of the bad things about this game is that only two players can play it in the same game. We think it would be great if we add a game mode to increase the amount of players per game by playing 2 vs 2, for instance. This game mode would be chosen in the waiting-room, so we would have to think of a way to sync both peers on choosing the same game mode. We could do this through the signaling channel before joining the game-room. The game mode logic would be decided in the future. For now, we are thinking on making each team choose 2 characters, and the winner team would have to guess correctly both of those characters.

8. Add filters to the camera so users can have them on during the call.

Filters are everywhere and everybody loves them. We think that adding filters to the video call is a way of making it more fun as well as giving the user a chance to react to some of the other player's good or bad questions with funny emojis or filters live during the game.

9. Let the user change the theme or color of the chat/page

Personalization is what makes applications interesting to most users. We think users should have the possibility to personalize the design of the page as they want. To do that, we could add a menu bar popup on the side of the page with all the available options.
